# WhatToEat Demo

This project is solving a problem I often have. When I get hungry, I usually do not know what to cook. To solve this problem, I am making a program that will choose what I should make and eat. The program will take an input of ingredients and then find a meal I know how to cook that has carbs, fats and protein. It will be made using Python as it will be all done through the console. I plan on using a tree data structure to catagorize each component (carbs, fats and proteins) to gain experience using the data structure then using a hashmap, I will have the meal as the key and incredients as the value.

To figure out which foods is a carb, fat or protein, I will collect my own data and make a data sheet where my python program will read and look for it's type. The reason this is only a demo program is because I do not have an easy way to collect the data and it will be manually made. Not only that, it is only for breakfast. In later updates, it will include lunch, dinner, and hopefully a more efficient way to collect data. Stay tuned!
