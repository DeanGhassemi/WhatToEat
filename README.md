# WhatToEat

This project is solving a problem I often have. When I get hungry, I usually do not know what to cook. To solve this problem, I am making a program that will choose what I should make and eat. The program will take an input of ingredients and then find a meal I know how to cook that has carbs, fats and protein. It will be made using Python as it will be all done through the console. More information will come with updates!
