# WhatToEat
This is a personal project to help me choose something to cook then eat. I am looking to gain muscle and a big factor for myself is gaining weight. To gain weight, I must eat. Something that prevents me from eating is not knowing what to eat. A step forward is removing this problem since if I do not know what to eat, I will ignore my hunger out of habit.
There is no fancy reason I am using python. Python is my most comfortable language to program in and I have yet to make much in python. So it will be fun
